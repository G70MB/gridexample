        <p>Pieter Cornelis Mondriaan 
            (Dutch: [ˈpitər kɔrˈneːlɪs ˈmɔndrijaːn]), 
            after 1906 known as Piet Mondrian (/piːt ˈmɒndriɑːn/, also US: /- ˈmɔːn-/, Dutch: [pit ˈmɔndrijɑn];
             7 March 1872 – 1 February 1944), was a 
             Dutch painter and art theoretician who
              is regarded as one of the greatest
               artists of the 20th century. He is 
               known for being one of the pioneers
                of 20th-century abstract art, as he
                 changed his artistic direction from
                  figurative painting to an increasingly
                   abstract style, until he reached a point 
                   where his artistic vocabulary was reduced
                    to simple geometric elements.

            Mondrian's art was highly utopian
             and was concerned with a search 
             for universal values and aesthetics.
              He proclaimed in 1914: "Art is 
              higher than reality and has no
               direct relation to reality. To 
               approach the spiritual in art, 
               one will make as little use as 
               possible of reality, because 
               reality is opposed to the spiritual.
                We find ourselves in the presence of 
                an abstract art. Art should be above 
                reality, otherwise it would have no 
                value for man."
            
                He was a contributor to the De Stijl art
                 movement and group, which he co-founded 
                 with Theo van Doesburg. He evolved a 
                 non-representational form which he 
                 termed Neoplasticism. This was the 
                 new 'pure plastic art' which he believed
                  was necessary in order to create 
                  'universal beauty'. To express this, 
                  Mondrian eventually decided to limit his 
                  formal vocabulary to the three primary 
                  colors (red, blue and yellow), the three
                   primary values (black, white and gray) 
                   and the two primary directions (horizontal 
                   and vertical). Mondrian's arrival in Paris
                    from the Netherlands in 1911 marked the 
                    beginning of a period of profound change. 
                    He encountered experiments in Cubism and
                     with the intent of integrating himself 
                     within the Parisian avant-garde removed an 
                     'a' from the Dutch spelling of his name (Mondriaan).
